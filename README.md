How the game works
This is a game app where the user clicks roll to roll a set of three dice. When the button is clicked, random numbers are generated on the dice(upto 6)
If two same numbers appear on the dice, user gets 50 points. If all the three dice match, the user gets 100 times the number and the total is added to the score. I'd no die matches the other, the user is prompted to try again.
